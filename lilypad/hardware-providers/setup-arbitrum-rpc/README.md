# Setup Arbitrum RPC

The Lilypad Network uses the Arbitrum Sepolia Testnet to settle compute transactions.

{% hint style="info" %}
The Lilypad Network is not responsible for issues caused by misconfigured RPC endpoints. Please use at your own risk!
{% endhint %}

This personal RPC endpoint allows Resource Providers (RP) to avoid reliability issues with the RPC endpoints used by Lilypad ensuring rewards can be earned and jobs can be run consistently. RPs running a personal RPC endpoint contribute to the fault tolerance and decentralization of the Lilypad Network!
