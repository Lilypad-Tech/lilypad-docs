  Below are instructions for setting up and running on the public Lilypad
  testnet, including adding a node, obtaining necessary funds, installing
  required software, and ensuring security measures.

# Running a Node

### Network information and testnet tokens

The testnet has a base currency of ETH, as well as a utility token called LP. LP is used for both paying for jobs and staking nodes. To add a node to the testnet, follow these steps:

#### MetaMask

We recommend using MetaMask with custom settings to make things easier. Once you have it installed and setup, here are the settings you need to use:

* Network name: Lilypad v3 Milky Way testnet
* New RPC URL:[ http://testnet.lilypad.tech:8545](http://testnet.lilypad.tech:8545/)
* Chain ID: 1337
* Currency symbol: ETH
* Block explorer URL: (leave blank)

#### Fund your wallet with ETH and LP

To obtain testnet ETH and LP, go to the [Lilypad faucet](http://faucet.lilypad.tech) and enter your ETH address.

The faucet will give you both ETH (to pay for gas) and LP (to stake and pay for jobs).

### Prerequisites

* Linux (latest Ubuntu LTS recommended)
* Nvidia GPU
* Nvidia drivers
* Docker
* Nvidia docker drivers

#### Install Nvidia Container Toolkit

To ensure proper operation of your graphics cards and Lilypad, follow these steps to install the Nvidia Toolkit Base Installer: [Nvidia Container Toolkit download page](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://nvidia.github.io/libnvidia-container/gpgkey | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/nvidia-container-toolkit-keyring.gpg \
  && curl -s -L https://nvidia.github.io/libnvidia-container/stable/deb/nvidia-container-toolkit.list | \
    sed 's#deb https://#deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/nvidia-container-toolkit-keyring.gpg] https://#g' | \
    sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/nvidia-container-toolkit.list
    
sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install -y nvidia-container-toolkit
```

Configure the container runtime by using the nvidia-ctk command:

```bash
 sudo nvidia-ctk runtime configure --runtime=docker
```

The nvidia-ctk command modifies the `/etc/docker/daemon.json` file on the host. The file is updated so that Docker can use the NVIDIA Container Runtime.

Restart the Docker daemon:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart docker
```

#### Install Bacalhau

Bacalhau is a peer-to-peer network of nodes that enables decentralized communication between computers. The network consists of two types of nodes, which can communicate with each other.

To install Bacalhau, run the following in your terminal:

```bash
cd /tmp

wget https://github.com/bacalhau-project/bacalhau/releases/download/v1.3.0/bacalhau_v1.3.0_linux_amd64.tar.gz

tar xfv bacalhau_v1.3.0_linux_amd64.tar.gz

sudo mv bacalhau /usr/bin/bacalhau

sudo mkdir -p /app/data/ipfs

sudo chown -R $USER /app/data
```

#### Install Lilypad

1.  **With Go toolchain**

    ```bash
    go install github.com/lilypad-tech/lilypad@latest
    ```
2.  **Via official released binaries**

    ```bash
    # Detect your machine's architecture and set it as $OSARCH
    OSARCH=$(uname -m | awk '{if ($0 ~ /arm64|aarch64/) print "arm64"; else if ($0 ~ /x86_64|amd64/) print "amd64"; else print "unsupported_arch"}') && export OSARCH
    # Detect your operating system and set it as $OSNAME
    OSNAME=$(uname -s | awk '{if ($1 == "Darwin") print "darwin"; else if ($1 == "Linux") print "linux"; else print "unsupported_os"}') && export OSNAME;
    # Download the latest production build
    curl https://api.github.com/repos/lilypad-tech/lilypad/releases/latest | grep "browser_download_url.*lilypad-$OSNAME-$OSARCH" | cut -d : -f 2,3 | tr -d \" | wget -qi - -O lilypad
    # Make Lilypad executable and install it
    chmod +x lilypad
    sudo mv lilypad /usr/local/bin/lilypad
    ```

#### Write env file

You will need to create an environment file for your node. `/app/lilypad/resource-provider-gpu.env` should contain:

```
WEB3_PRIVATE_KEY=<YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY> (the private key from a NEW MetaMask wallet FOR THE COMPUTE NODE)
```

This is the key where you will get paid in LP tokens for jobs run on the network.

{% hint style="warning" %}
You must not reuse your compute node key as a client, even for testing: this will result in failed jobs and will negatively impact your compute node since the wallet address is how nodes are identified on the network.
{% endhint %}

#### Install systemd unit for Bacalhau

systemd is a system and service manager for Linux operating systems. systemd operates as a central point of control for various aspects of system management, offering features like parallelization of service startup, dependency-based service management, process supervision, and more.

To install systemd, open `/etc/systemd/system/bacalhau.service` in your preferred editor:

{% hint style="info" %}
Hint: `sudo vim /etc/systemd/system/bacalhau.service`
{% endhint %}

<pre><code>[Unit]
Description=Lilypad V2 Bacalhau
After=network-online.target
Wants=network-online.target systemd-networkd-wait-online.service

[Service]
Environment="LOG_TYPE=json"
Environment="LOG_LEVEL=debug"
Environment="HOME=/app/lilypad"
Environment="BACALHAU_SERVE_IPFS_PATH=/app/data/ipfs"
<strong>Restart=always
</strong>RestartSec=5s
ExecStart=/usr/bin/bacalhau serve --node-type compute,requester --peer none --private-internal-ipfs=false

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
</code></pre>

#### Install systemd unit for GPU provider

Open `/etc/systemd/system/lilypad-resource-provider.service` in your preferred editor.

{% hint style="info" %}
Hint: `sudo vim /etc/systemd/system/lilypad-resource-provider.service`
{% endhint %}

```
[Unit]
Description=Lilypad V2 Resource Provider GPU
After=network-online.target
Wants=network-online.target systemd-networkd-wait-online.service

[Service]
Environment="LOG_TYPE=json"
Environment="LOG_LEVEL=debug"
Environment="HOME=/app/lilypad"
Environment="OFFER_GPU=1"
EnvironmentFile=/app/lilypad/resource-provider-gpu.env
Restart=always
RestartSec=5s
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/lilypad resource-provider 

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Reload systemd's units/daemons (you will need to do this again if you ever change the systemd unit files that we wrote, above)

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

Start systemd units:

```bash
sudo systemctl start bacalhau
sudo systemctl start lilypad-resource-provider
```

### Check Resource Provider Status

Check that the RP is running. You should see your resource provider start running and accepting jobs on the network in the logs:

`sudo journalctl -uf lilypad-resource-provider`&#x20;

This will give you a live output form your Lilypad node.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/carbon.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Run the following command to get more status info from your Resource Provider:

```
sudo journalctl -u lilypad-resouce-provider.service -f
```

{% hint style="info" %}
Please report any issues in the [Lilypad Discord](https://lilypad.team/discord).
{% endhint %}

### Security

If you want to allowlist only certain modules (e.g. Stable Diffusion modules), so that you can control exactly what code runs on your nodes (which you can audit to ensure that they are secure and will have no negative impact on your nodes), you can do that by setting an environment variable `OFFER_MODULES` in the GPU provider to a comma separated list of module names, e.g. `sdxl:v0.9-lilypad1,stable-diffusion:v0.0.1`

Visit the [Lilypad GitHub](https://github.com/Lilypad-Tech/lilypad#available-modules) for a full list of available modules.
