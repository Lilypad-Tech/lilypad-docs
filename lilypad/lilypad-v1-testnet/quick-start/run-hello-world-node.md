## Resource Provider Flow

As a resource provider:

* I register my resource offer and send my deposit against that single offer
* The offer is matched with a job and I run the job
* if I ran the job properly - I get my deposit back AND the cost of the job
* if I was caught cheating - I will lose my deposit
