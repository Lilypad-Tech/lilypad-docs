# üó∫Ô∏è Extra Labs x Lilypad

This is a work-in-progress proof of concept utilizing Extra Labs and Lilypad to create a Lilypad module for running multiple geospatial jobs.

The goal is to provide the end-to-end adapter for users to operate on the point cloud data to generate reconstructed maps.

Extra Labs is revolutionizing the way maps are built by leveraging collaborative acquisition and deep learning to produce affordable, detailed 3D models of cities and territories.

To achieve this proof of concept, the Lilypad module will integrate with Extra Labs' platform, allowing users to submit their geospatial data, whether collected via drones, aircraft, delivery vehicles, or smartphones. This data is processed through advanced algorithms to create detailed 3D reconstructions.

The decentralized nature of the platform ensures that data providers are compensated fairly for their contributions through a blockchain-based reward system. This approach not only democratizes access to 3D mapping technologies but also ensures continuous and up-to-date data acquisition, enhancing the accuracy and detail of the generated maps.

Users should be able to easily interact with the platform, upload their data, and receive high-quality 3D models in return. This process is designed to make advanced geospatial mapping accessible to a wide range of users, from urban planners and architects to developers and hobbyists.
