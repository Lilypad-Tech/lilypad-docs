## Hackathon & Project Ideas for Lilypad v1

Here's some ideas for what you could build with Lilypad v1!

{% hint style="info" %}
:green\_heart: Good first project

:yellow\_heart: Moderate skill needed

:heart: God mode!
{% endhint %}

1. :green\_heart: Build cowsay as a service! -> see [hello-cow-world.md](../examples/hello-cow-world.md "mention")
2. :green\_heart: Stable diffusion as a service (text to image) -> see [stable-diffusion.md](../examples/stable-diffusion.md "mention")
3. :yellow\_heart: Use Stable diffusion fine tuning as a service (e.g. give me pics of you and add a beer or whatever, via LoRA) - **this is a distributed compute network that triggers from a smart contract and that ACTUALLY CONSUMES DATA FROM IPFS and writes output data as CIDs and consumes them from inference -** this is breakthrough computing!
4. :yellow\_heart: Filecoin data prep: integrate with Filecoin service providers (requires knowledge of **Filecoin Storage Market**) -> see [filecoin-data-prep.md](../examples/filecoin-data-prep.md "mention")
5. :yellow\_heart: :yellow\_heart: Build a Javascript wrapper for the CLI
6. :heart: Advanced: arbitrary WASM - write your own code and compile it to WASM and run it
7. :heart: :heart: God Mode: Contribute a module (see below)

## Module Contributions!
