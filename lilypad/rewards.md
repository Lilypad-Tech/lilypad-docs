## Resource Providers

In exchange for providing compute power to Lilypad's decentralized compute network, Resource Providers (RPs) accumulate Lilybit\_ credits based on their contributions to the network.

RP incentives on Testnet will be provided via the Lilypad RP Beta Program. Any RP can submit info to join the RP beta program, although RPs with more resources will be prioritized in order to run large models on Lilypad Network.
