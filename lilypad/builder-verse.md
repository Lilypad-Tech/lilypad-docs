# üõ†Ô∏è BUILDER-VERSE

[Builder-verse](https://blog.lilypadnetwork.org/lilypad-builder-verse) is a space for developers, labs, and builders to create powerful tools and workflows on the Lilypad Network. It‚Äôs part of our mission to accelerate open source AI through decentralized compute infrastructure and accessible tooling.

### What is it?

An open, ongoing program designed to help you build with Lilypad. There are no deadlines or fixed formats. Whether you're creating modules, building agent workflows or integrating Lilypad into a larger stack, Builder-verse gives you the space, support and rewards to grow your ideas.

### How to participate

Lilypad rewards contributors who help grow the network, whether you're building modules and agents or providing GPU compute.

You don‚Äôt need to wait for a hackathon. Submit anytime and track your impact on the [leaderboard](https://oss.lilypad.tech). Top contributors may also be eligible for additional support, amplification, and future grant opportunities.

#### Builders

* Creating and [publishing modules](developer-resources/module-marketplace/build-a-job-module/)
* Building agents or full-stack applications that use Lilypad modules
* Driving usage. The more your module or agent is used, the more rewards you earn
