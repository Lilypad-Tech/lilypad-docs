## Overview

[Waterlily.ai](http://waterlily.ai/) is a proof-of-concept application aiming to provide an alternative ethical solution to AI-Art generation by creating a new paradigm for AI image generation that pays royalties to the original creator and offers a new revenue stream for artists to explore.

To achieve this, Waterlily leverages the transparency & trustlessness of blockchain, with [FVM](https://fvm.dev/) smart contracts, combined with a decentralised edge compute platform in [Bacalhau](https://docs.bacalhau.org/examples/) to deliver an intuitive user experience for generative AI-Art while compensating creators for their original work with every image generation call.

Each stable diffusion model on Waterlily is trained & finetuned to a selection of artist work that has been uploaded by the artist themselves or is available in the public domain. When a user navigates to the [Waterlily.ai](http://waterlily.ai/) platform, they simply enter a text prompt for the images they want to create and choose an artist style that appeals to them.\
\
The small fee paid by the user is then distributed to the artist's wallet (except the fees required by the network to run the contract calls & return the generated images) - or to a vetted creator foundation in the case of public images.

A user can then opt to download these generated images or mint them as NFTs.
