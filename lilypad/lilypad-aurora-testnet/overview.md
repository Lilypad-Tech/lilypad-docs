  # Overview

  ### What is Lilypad?
  Lilypad is a verifiable trustless decentralized compute network. It aims to enable mainstream web3 applications by providing global, permissionless access to compute power. Lilypad leverages decentralized physical infrastructure networks like Filecoin to create an open compute network that is more accessible, efficient, and transparent. It addresses the challenges surrounding access to AI models and hardware by offering decentralized AI capabilities. Lilypad has recently released Lilypad V2 (Aurora) and has plans to go multichain and launch an incentivized test net.

  ### Objective and problem statement
  Lilypad is aiming to solve the challenges surrounding access to AI models and hardware. Currently, there are significant barriers to entry for developers and organizations who want to leverage AI in their applications. Access to AI models and hardware is often limited, expensive, and centralized. Lilypad aims to address these issues by creating a verifiable trustless decentralized compute network that provides global, permissionless access to compute power. By leveraging decentralized physical infrastructure networks like Filecoin, Lilypad aims to make AI more accessible, efficient, and transparent. 

  ### Applications
  The ability to perform off-chain decentralised compute over data from smart contracts opens the door to a multitude of possible applications including:

  * Inference AI jobs
  * ML training jobs
  * Invoking & supporting generic ZK computations
  * Cross-chain interoperability complement to bridge protocols
  * Utilising inbuilt storage on IPFS
  * Federated Learning consensus (with Bacalhau insulated jobs)
  * IOT & Sensor Data integrations
  * Providing a platform for Digital twins
  * Supply chain tracking & analysis
  * ETL & data preparation jobs

  ### Key features
  Some of the key features of Lilypad include:

  1. **Verifiable Trustless Decentralized Compute Network**: Lilypad is a decentralized compute network that aims to provide global, permissionless access to compute power. It leverages decentralized physical infrastructure networks like Filecoin to ensure trustlessness and verifiability.

  2. **Mainstream Web3 Application Support**: Lilypad is designed to enable mainstream web3 applications to use its compute network. It aims to make decentralized AI more accessible, efficient, and transparent for developers and users.

  3. **Open Compute Network**: Lilypad creates an open compute network that allows users to access and run AI models and jobs. It separates module creators from users and curates a set of deterministic modules for users to run, ensuring determinism in verification systems.

  4. **Multichain Support**: Lilypad plans to go multichain, which means it will support multiple blockchain networks. This will increase the scalability and interoperability of the network, allowing users to choose the blockchain that best suits their needs.

  5. **Incentivized Test Net**: Lilypad has plans to launch an incentivized test net, which will provide users with incentives to participate in testing and improving the network. This will help identify and address any issues or challenges before the mainnet launch.

  6. **Decentralization of Mediators**: The team also aims to decentralize the mediators in the network. This means that the decision-making process and governance of the network will be distributed among multiple participants, ensuring a more decentralized and resilient system.
