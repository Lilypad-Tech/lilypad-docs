# Lilypad Workflows

At Lilypad, weâ€™ve integrated n8n with the Lilypad API to automate dynamic workflows, combining human input, AI generation and multi-platform actions.

Using Lilypadâ€™s OpenAI-compatible endpoints inside n8n lets you:

* ðŸ§  Source and enrich content: Pull from databases like Notion, Airtable, or Google Sheets and enhance it with AI.
* ðŸŽ¨ Generate custom outputs: Create AI-written text, summaries, or even modify images dynamically.
* ðŸ”„ Automate publishing: Push results to platforms like Twitter, Discord, Slack, or your own apps.
* ðŸ“ˆ Track and update: Monitor workflow status and feed results back into your systems.

Everything runs automatically inside n8n, with Lilypad API endpoints providing powerful, cost-free AI capabilities at the heart of it.

Imagine building workflows that review customer feedback with AI, generate personalized emails, summarize research papers, trigger alerts from on-chain events, or even create full content campaigns, all without writing a single script. With n8n and Lilypad, AI-driven automation is at your fingertips.
