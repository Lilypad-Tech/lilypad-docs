## üçÉ General Questions

### What is the Lilypad Network?

Lilypad is developing a serverless, distributed compute network that enables internet-scale data processing for AI, ML & other arbitrary computation from blockchains, while unleashing idle processing power & unlocking a new marketplace for compute.

Lilypad provides decentralized AI computational services. By extending unrestricted, global access to computational power, Lilypad strategically collaborates with decentralized infrastructure networks, such as Filecoin, to formulate a transparent, efficient, and accessible computational ecosystem.&#x20;

Perform off-chain decentralized compute over data, with on-chain guarantees, and to call this functionality directly from a smart contract, CLI and an easy to use abstraction layer, opens the door to a multitude of possible applications.

### Lilypad Litepaper

Lilypad released a [Litepaper](https://docs.lilypad.tech/lilypad/research-and-vision/whitepaper) and will release a Whitepaper soon!

### Roadmap

Lilypad Network is currently in Testnet. The team is currently ironing out some remaining known issues and working on a fair model for our Incentivized Testnet.

### Has Lilypad raised VC money?

Yes, Lilypad closed our seed round of funding in March 2024.

## üåê Incentivized Testnet Questions

### When will the Incentivized Testnet launch?

The Lilypad Incentivized testnet is on track to launch by the end of June 2024. Stay tuned on [the Lilypad Discord](https://lilypad.team/discord) for more info!

### How do LilyBit\_ rewards work?

Lilybit\_ rewards will be awarded to nodes for time on the network (up to a 4x multiplier) and compute power brought to the network. Rewards will be redeemable, for the Lilypad ERC20 Utility Token at Mainnet Launch, with between 5% and 10% of the total token supply (depending on IncentiveNet demand and tokenomics finalization) being allocated to this phase of the Lilypad Network.

### Who can earn LilyBit\_ rewards

Phase 1 of the Incentivized Testnet is focused on rewarding nodes on the network, referred to as Resource Providers. The earlier a provider joins the network, the more Lilybits\_ will be available.

Phases 2 and onward will provide rewards for Lilypad modules created as well as developer tools/apps (in addition to rewarding nodes)

## üë©‚Äçüíª Developer Questions

### What is a Lilypad Module?

To run a ML model like Stable Diffusion on Lilypad, the model must be setup as a Lilypad Module (see instructions below). Once setup, modules are run with the Lilypad [CLI](https://docs.lilypad.tech/lilypad/lilypad-milky-way-testnet/install-run-requirements) or [API](https://docs.lilypad.tech/lilypad/lilypad-milky-way-reference/javascript-cli-wrapper).

### How to run a ML job on Lilypad

To run a ML job on Lilypad (Stable Diffusion, Mistral 7b, Stable Diffusion Video, and more) using the Lilypad CLI, follow the [CLI instructions](https://docs.lilypad.tech/lilypad/lilypad-milky-way-testnet/install-run-requirements) to get started.&#x20;

To build an application with Lilypad compute and modules on the backend, check out this [guide](https://blog.lilypadnetwork.org/setting-up-your-lilypad-front-end).

### How to add a ML model to run on Lilypad

A Lilypad module is a Git repository that can be used to perform various tasks using predefined templates and inputs. This ["build a job module" guide](https://docs.lilypad.tech/lilypad/lilypad-milky-way-reference/build-a-job-module) will walk you through the process of creating a Lilypad module, including defining a JSON template, handling inputs, ensuring determinism, and other best practices.

### How to run a Lilypad node

Lilypad is an open network that allows anyone to contribute GPU computing capacity. There is currently no cost or incentives for running a Lilypad node. Find [instructions](https://docs.lilypad.tech/lilypad/lilypad-milky-way-reference/run-a-node) for running a node in the docs.

### Node hardware specs

* Linux (latest Ubuntu LTS recommended)
* Nvidia GPU
* Nvidia drivers
* Docker
* Nvidia docker drivers

For more information on the requirements to run a Lilypad node, please refer to the [hardware requirements](hardware-providers/hardware-requirements.md) documentation.

## üìñ Token Questions

### Lilypad Tokenomics

Currently, there's no cost to run jobs and no incentive. Tokenomics and research papers are currently being developed and expected by early Q3 2024.&#x20;

### Expected TGE

Although the launch date is not finalized, the launch of Lilypad Mainnet and the TGE for LP tokens is scheduled for Q4 2024.
