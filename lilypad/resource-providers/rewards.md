# Rewards

GPUs contributing to the Lilypad Network can earn Lilybit\_ credits daily, which will be redeemable for Lilypad (LP) mainnet tokens at the Token Generation Event (TGE), expected in Q2 of 2025. To provide compute power and participate in Lilypad's decentralized compute network, Resource Providers (RPs) can accumulate these credits based on their contributions to the network.

The next phase of Resource Provider (RP) incentives on Testnet will be provided via the RP Beta Testnet! Any RP can submit info to join the [RP beta program](https://forms.gle/sLDrgUXeV7HpCmSq8), although RPs with more resources will be prioritized in order to run large models on Lilypad. More info will be released with details on the Beta Testnet.

Find past info on the Lilybit\_ rewards system [here](https://blog.lilypadnetwork.org/update-to-the-lilybit-rewards-calculation). This IncentiveNet program stage has ended and will be replaced by the Beta RP program.&#x20;
