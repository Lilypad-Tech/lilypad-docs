## Vision

Lilypad is aiming to build an internet-scale trustless distributed compute network for web3. Creating the infrastructure for use cases like AI inference, ML training, DeSci and more.

## Overview

Lilypad currently enables user to access verifiable, distributed off-chain compute directly from smart contracts.\
\
Lilypad is at version 0  - a Proof of Concept project operating as an integration layer between Bacalhau compute jobs and solidity smart contracts on the Filecoin Network. This integration enables users to access verifiable off-chain decentralised compute from DApps and smart contract projects, enabling interactions and innovations between on-chain and off-chain compute. \
\
Lilypad v0 does not charge for compute jobs, outside of network running fees (ie. the cost of transactions on the blockchain network it is deployed to). It operates on the Bacalhau public compute network (which is free to use), though it is worth noting that there are no reliability guarantees given for this network (which is something future versions of this protocol will be working to improve).\


## What is Bacalhau?

Bacalhau is a peer to peer computation network enabling compute over data jobs like GPU-enabled AI, ML, analytics, data engineering, data science, de-sci and more.

Bacalhau aims to transform data processing & improve cost, efficiency & security by running jobs where the data is generated and stored. With Bacalhau, you can streamline your existing workflows without the need of extensive rewriting by running arbitrary Docker containers and WebAssembly (wasm) images as tasks.

To find out more about it, see the Bacalhau [Docs](https://docs.bacalhau.org/)!

## Lilypad Roadmap

* v0: **September 2022** - Lilypad Bridge POC for triggering and returning Bacalhau compute jobs from a smart contract
* v1: **July 2023** - A [modicum](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3401025.3401737)-based minimal testnet (EVM-based). See [github](https://github.com/bacalhau-project/MODICUM)
* v2: **September 2023** - A more robust trustless distributed testnet
* v3: tbd - Lilypad Mainnet
