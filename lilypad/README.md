# üçÉ Lilypad Overview

## Vision

Lilypad is aiming to build an internet-scale trustless distributed compute network for web3. Creating the infrastructure for use cases like AI inference, ML training,&#x20;

## Overview

Currently Lilypad is at v0  - a Proof of Concept project operating as an integration layer between Bacalhau compute jobs and solidity smart contracts. This enables users to access verifiable off-chain decentralised compute from DApps and smart contract projects, enabling interactions and innovations between on-chain and off-chain compute. \
\
Lilypad v0 does not charge for compute jobs, outside of network running fees (ie. the cost of transactions on the blockchain network it is deployed to). It operates on the Bacalhau public compute network (which is free to use), though it is worth noting that there are no reliability guarantees given for this network (which is something future versions of this protocol will be working to improve)\
\
These docs will focus exclusively on using the Lilypad v0 relayer network to enable off-chain computation over data for web3 applications and DApps.&#x20;

## Lilypad Roadmap

* v0: **September 2022** - Lilypad Bridge POC for triggering and returning Bacalhau compute jobs from a smart contract
* v1: **July 2023** - A [modicum](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3401025.3401737)-based minimal testnet (EVM-based). See [github](https://github.com/bacalhau-project/MODICUM)
* v2: **September 2023** - A more robust trustless distributed testnet
* v3: tbd - Lilypad Mainnet
