# Setup

To interact with Lilypad's API, you'll first need to create an account and obtain an **API key** for authentication. This key allows you to submit jobs and retrieve results securely.

### Sign Up

Visit the [Lilypad API Dashboard](https://anura.lilypad.tech/) and sign up using an email address.&#x20;

### Generate API key

Next, log in to the dashboard and click "Create API key".

Now that you've created a new API key you can copy and securely store your API key for usage.
