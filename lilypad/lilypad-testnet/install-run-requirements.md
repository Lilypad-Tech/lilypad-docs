# Installation (CLI)

## Install Lilypad CLI

The installation process for the Lilypad CLI involves several automated steps to configure it for your specific system. Initially, the setup script identifies your computer's architecture and operating system to ensure compatibility. It will then download the latest production build of the Lilypad CLI directly from the official GitHub repository using `curl` and `wget`.

Once the CLI tool is downloaded, the script sets the necessary permissions to make the executable file runnable. It then moves the executable to a standard location in your system's path to allow it to be run from any terminal window.

### 1. Install via officially released binaries

```bash
# Detect your machine's architecture and set it as $OSARCH
OSARCH=$(uname -m | awk '{if ($0 ~ /arm64|aarch64/) print "arm64"; else if ($0 ~ /x86_64|amd64/) print "amd64"; else print "unsupported_arch"}') && export OSARCH;
# Detect your operating system and set it as $OSNAME
OSNAME=$(uname -s | awk '{if ($1 == "Darwin") print "darwin"; else if ($1 == "Linux") print "linux"; else print "unsupported_os"}') && export OSNAME;
# Download the latest production build
curl https://api.github.com/repos/lilypad-tech/lilypad/releases/latest | grep "browser_download_url.*lilypad-$OSNAME-$OSARCH" | cut -d : -f 2,3 | tr -d \" | wget -qi - -O lilypad

# Make Lilypad executable and install it
chmod +x lilypad
sudo mv lilypad /usr/local/bin/lilypad
```

### 2. Set WEB3\_PRIVATE\_KEY

You're required to set your private key environment variable, `WEB3_PRIVATE_KEY`, to interact securely with the network.&#x20;

```bash
export WEB3_PRIVATE_KEY=<your private key>
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
To use the Lilypad CLI, the set private key will need to hold [Lilypad testnet tokens](quick-start/funding-your-wallet-from-faucet.md).&#x20;
{% endhint %}

### 3. Verify installation

To verify the installation, running `lilypad` in the terminal should display a list of available commands, indicating that Lilypad CLI is ready to use.

```bash
Lilypad

Usage:
  lilypad [command]

Available Commands:
  completion        Generate the autocompletion script for the specified shell
  help              Help about any command
  mediator          Start the lilypad mediator service.
  resource-provider Start the lilypad resource-provider service.
  run               Run a job on the Lilypad network.
  solver            Start the lilypad solver service.

Flags:
  -h, --help   help for lilypad

Use "lilypad [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```

Thats it! You've successfully installed the Lilypad CLI on your machine! [ðŸŽ‰](https://emojipedia.org/party-popper)
