## Overview

This guide will take you through:

* Setting up [MetaMask Wallet](https://metamask.io) for the Lilypad Testnet so that you can get ETH and LP tokens to fund smart contract calls on Ethereum's Arbitrum testnet, and pay for jobs on Lilypad Testnet.
* Fund your wallet with Lilypad Testnet tokens from the [faucet](http://faucet.lilypad.tech/)
* Run a Hello, (Lilysay) World! example compute job on the Lilypad Network :frog:
